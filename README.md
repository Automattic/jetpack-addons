# Jetpack Addons

Here is a (growing) list of plugins that can be used to customize Jetpack's behaviour. To use those plugins, download the zip files using the links below, and then go to Plugins > Add New > Upload in your dashboard.

Note that these plugins were built to address specific questions from Jetpack users. They may not fit your exact needs. You may consequently need to customize them yourself.

If you experience issues with one of those plugins, you can contact Jetpack support [here](http://jetpack.com/contact-support/).
